//Description: The purpose of this script is to generate a 2-noded truss element (T3D2) for analysis in CalculiX
//Date: July 9th, 2018
//Analyst: Garrett M. Kelley

//Define variables
L = 1; //Bar length
cl = 1; //Characteristic length

//Define end points of bar
Point(1) = {0,0,0,cl};
Point(2) = {L,0,0,cl};

//Define the bar axis
Line(1) = {1,2};

//Define the physical groups
Physical Point("BOUNDARY_NODE",1) = {1};
Physical Point("LOAD_NODE", 2) = {2};
Physical Line("BAR", 3) = {1};
