# CCX-TCs

## Purpose

This repository stores finite element test cases built for CalculiX CrunchiX (CCX) 2.14. The purpose is to understand both the finite element code inputs and accompanying outputs. This will increase user confidence in the code through an understanding of when certain elements should (or shouldn't) be used.
